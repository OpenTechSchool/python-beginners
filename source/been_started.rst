Getting started
***************

What you'll need
================

A Python!
---------

If you haven't yet got python, the latest official installation packages 
can be found here:

http://python.org/download/

Python 3 is preferable, being the newest version out!

.. note::

   On Windows, you'll need to add :program:`Python` to your ``%PATH%``, so it 
   can be found by other programs.

   When installing Python 3.5 or later, there should be tick box 
   option to do this on the first page of the installer. Make sure you tick this on.

   Otherwise, you can run the script under :file:`\Tools\Scripts\win_add2path.py`
   where you installed Python.

And a Code Editor
-----------------

A code editor helps with reading and writing programming code. There are 
many around, and it is one of the most personal choices a programmer can 
make - Like a tennis-player choosing their racket, or a chef choosing their 
favourite knife. To start off with, you'll just want a basic, easy-to-use one 
that doesn't get in your way, but is still effective at writing python code. 
Here are some suggestions for those:

- `Atom`_: Windows, Mac & Linux. A new code editor made by Github. It's 
  an open-source project and is very easy to add functionality for, 
  with its packages system.

- `Sublime Text`_: Windows, Mac & Linux. A great all around editor that's 
  easy to use. It's Ctl+B shortcut lets you run the python file you're working 
  on straight away.

- `Geany`_: Windows, Mac & Linux. A simple editor that doesn't aim 
  to be too complicated.

- `TextMate`_: Mac. One of the most famous code editors for Mac, it used to 
  be a paid product but has since been open-sourced.

- `Gedit`_ and `Kate`_: Linux. If you run Linux using Gnome or KDE respectively, 
  you might already have one of these two installed!

- `Komodo Edit`_: Windows, Mac & Linux. a sleak, free editor based on the 
  more powerful Komodo IDE.

.. tip::

   Wordpad, TextEdit, Notepad, and Word are **not** suitable code editors.

What is Python, exactly?
========================

Ok, so python is this thing called a **programming language**. It takes text that 
you've written (usually referred to as **code**), turns it into instructions for 
your computer, and runs those instructions. We'll be learning how to write code 
to do cool and useful stuff. No longer will you be bound to use *others'* 
programs to do things with your computer - you can make your own!

Practically, Python is just another program on your computer. The first thing to 
learn is how to use and interact with it. There are in fact many ways to do this; 
the first one to learn is to interact with python's interpreter, 
using your **operating system's** (OS) console.

A **console** (or 'terminal', or 'command prompt') is a *textual* way to 
interact with your OS, just as the 'desktop', in conjunction with your mouse, 
is the *graphical* way to interact your system.

Opening a console on Mac OS X
-----------------------------

OS X's standard console is a program called :program:`Terminal`. Open Terminal by 
navigating to Applications, then Utilities, then double-click the 
:program:`Terminal` program. You can also easily search for it in the system 
search tool in the top right.

The command line Terminal is a tool for interacting with your 
computer. A window will open with a command line prompt message, 
something like this::

    mycomputer:~ myusername$

Opening a console on Linux
--------------------------

Different linux distributions (e.g Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint) may have different 
console programs, usually referred to as a terminal. The exact terminal 
you start up, and how, can depend on your distribution. On Ubuntu, you will 
likely want to open :program:`Gnome Terminal`. It should present a prompt like this::

    myusername@mycomputer:~$

Opening a console on Windows
----------------------------

Window's console is called the Command Prompt, named :program:`cmd`.  An easy
way to get to it is by using the key combination :kbd:`Windows+R`
(:kbd:`Windows` meaning the windows logo button), which should open a
:guilabel:`Run` dialog.  Then type :program:`cmd` and hit :kbd:`Enter` or
click :guilabel:`Ok`. You can also search for it from the start menu. It should
look like::

    C:\Users\myusername>

Window's Command Prompt is not quite as powerful as its counterparts on Linux 
and OS X, so you might like to start the Python Interpreter (see just below) 
directly, or using the :program:`IDLE` program that Python comes with. 
You can find these in the Start menu.

Using Python
============

The python program that you have installed will by default act as something 
called an **interpreter**. An interpreter takes text commands and runs 
them as you enter them - very handy for trying things out.

Just type :program:`python` at your console, hit :kbd:`Enter`, and you should 
enter Python's Interpreter.

To find out which version of python you're running, 
instead type  ``python -V`` in your console to tell you.

Interacting With Python
-----------------------

After Python opens, it will show you some contextual information similar to this::

    Python 3.5.0 (default, Sep 20 2015, 11:28:25) 
    [GCC 5.2.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

.. note::

   The prompt **>>>** on the last line indicates that you are now in an
   interactive Python interpeter session, also called the "Python shell".
   **This is different from the normal terminal command prompt!**

You can now enter some code for python to run. Try::

    print("Hello world")

Press :kbd:`Enter` and see what happens. After showing the results, Python 
will bring you back to the interactive prompt, where you could enter 
another command:

    >>> print("Hello world")
    Hello world
    >>> (1 + 4) * 2
    10

An extremely useful command is ``help()``, which enters a help functionality 
to explore all the stuff python lets you do, right from the interpreter.
Press :kbd:`q` to close the help window and return to the Python prompt.

To leave the interactive shell and go back to the console (the *system* shell), 
press :kbd:`Ctrl-Z` and then :kbd:`Enter` on Windows, or :kbd:`Ctrl-D` on 
OS X or Linux. Alternatively, you could also run the python command ``exit()``!


Exercise
--------

Just above we demonstrated entering a command to figure out some math. Try 
some math commands of your own! What operations does python know? Get it 
to tell you what 239 and 588 added together, and then squared is.

.. rst-class:: solution

Solution
--------

Here are  some ways you might have got the answer:


    >>> 239 + 588
    827
    >>> 827 * 827
    683929

    >>> (239 + 588) * (239 + 588)
    683929

    >>> (239 + 588) ** 2
    683929

Running Python files
--------------------

When you have a lot of python code to run, you will want to save it into 
a file, so for instance, you can modify small parts of it (fix a bug) and 
re-run the code without having to repeatedly re-type the rest. 
Instead of typing commands in one-by-one you can save your code to a 
file and pass the file name to the :program:`python` program. 
It will execute that file's code instead of 
launching its interactive interpreter.

**Let's try that!**  Create a file :file:`hello.py` in your current directory
with your favorite code editor and write the print command from above.  Now
save that file. On Linux or OS X, you can also run ``touch hello.py`` to create
an empty file to edit. To run this file with python, it's pretty easy:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python hello.py

.. note::

   Make sure you are at your system command prompt, which will have ``$`` or 
   ``>`` at the end, **not** at python's (which has ``>>>`` instead)!

On Windows you should also be able to double-click the Python file to run it.

When pressing :kbd:`Enter` now, the file is executed and you see the output 
as before.  But this time, after Python finished executing all commands from 
that file it exits back to the system command prompt, instead of going back 
to the interactive shell.

And now we are all set and can get started with turtle!

.. note::

   Not getting "Hello world" but some crazy error about "can't open 
   file" or "No such file or directory?" Your command line might not be 
   running in the directory that you saved the file in. You can change 
   the working directory of your current command line with the 
   :command:`cd` command, which stands for "change directory". On Windows, 
   you might want something like::

     > cd Desktop\Python_Exercises

   On Linux or OS X, you might want something like:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ cd Desktop/Python_Exercises

   This changes to the directory Python_Exercises under the Desktop folder 
   (yours might be somewhere different). If you don't know the location 
   of the directory where you saved the file, you can simply drag the 
   directory to the command line window.  If you don't know which 
   directory your shell is currently running in use :command:`pwd`, 
   which stands for "print working directory".

.. warning::

   When playing around with turtle, avoid naming your file :file:`turtle.py` 
   --- rather use more appropriate names such as :file:`square.py` or 
   :file:`rectangle.py`.  Otherwise, whenever you refer to ``turtle``, Python 
   will pick up *your* file instead of the standard Python turtle module.
