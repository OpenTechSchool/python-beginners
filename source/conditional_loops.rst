Conditional Loops
***************** 
Introduction
============

Conditional loops are way to repeat something while a certain condition 
is satisfied, or **True**. If the condition is always satisfied (never 
becomes **False**), the loop can become infinite. 
If the condition starts off false, the code in the loop will never run! 
In Python conditional loops are defined with the ``while`` statement::

    word = ''
    sentence = ''
    print('Please enter some words.')
    print('Include a period (.) when you are finished.')
    while '.' not in word:
        word = input('next word: ')
        sentence = word + ' ' + sentence
    print()
    print('Aha! You said:')
    print(sentence)

We call this part of the code the 'conditional': ``'.' not in word``

Whether the conditional returns True or not determines whether the code inside 
the ``while`` loop runs. Of course, it repeats the check every time the loop
is run again.

Read the code above, and see if you can summarise in your head what 
it should do (what its final output will be).

Then copy it into a file, say :file:`sentence.py` and run it - see 
exactly what it does. Does that match up with what you thought?

.. note::

   If you are using Python 2, you will need to replace ``input`` with 
   ``raw_input`` to run the program correctly.

Turtle prison
=============

Exercise
--------

The turtle has been up to its usual tricks again, robbing liquor 
stores and building up huge gambling debts. It's time for turtle to be 
put into a cell that it can't get out of.

Let's make a new version of ``forward()``. One that will turn the turtle 
around if it tries to go further than 100 from the origin. We'll need 
a ``while`` loop, and some new turtle functions:

* ``turtle.distance(0, 0)`` - Returns the distance of the turtle from 
  the origin (0, 0)
* ``turtle.towards(0, 0)`` - Returns the angle to get back to origin (0, 0)
* ``turtle.setheading(angle)`` - Directly sets the turtle's direction

You could try playing with a turtle in the interpreter and using these 
functions to check exactly what they do, if you like.

Now you will need to implement the prison logic using these turtle 
functions, perhaps a ``while`` loop and a bit of conditional logic. 
It's a bit of a stretch but keep at it! Don't be afraid to talk it out 
with a coach or another student.

.. rst-class:: solution

Solution
--------

::

  def forward(distance):
      while distance > 0:
          if turtle.distance(0,0) > 100:
              angle = turtle.towards(0,0)
              turtle.setheading(angle)
          turtle.forward(1)
          distance = distance - 1


Draw a spiral
=============

Loops can be interrupted with the ``break`` statement. This is 
especially useful if you write an *infinite loop*, which is a loop 
where the conditional is always **True**.

Exercise
--------

Write a ``while`` loop with a condition that is always **True** 
to draw a spiral. Interrupt the loop when the turtle reaches a certain distance 
from the center. Use the function ``turtle.distance(x, y)`` to get the 
turtle's distance to the point defined by the coordinates ``x`` and ``y``.

To do this you will need the ``turtle.xcor()`` and ``turtle.ycor()`` 
functions, which return the position of the turtle in X and Y axes 
respectively. 

.. note::

   To draw a spiral, the turtle has to rotate by a constant value and move
   forward by an increasing value.

.. rst-class:: solution

Solution
--------

::

    def draw_spiral(radius):
        original_xcor = turtle.xcor()
        original_ycor = turtle.ycor()
        speed = 1
        while True:
            turtle.forward(speed)
            turtle.left(10)
            speed += 0.1
            if turtle.distance(original_xcor, original_ycor) > radius:
                break

Bonus
-----

Can you make a conditional for this loop, so you don't need the 
infinite loop ``while True`` or the ``break``? Which version do you find 
easier to understand?
