"Programmers can deal with some pretty complex and abstract problems, but one"
" sign of a good programmer is that they're lazy. They only like to deal with"
" one thing at a time. So you need a way to break up problems into smaller, "
"discrete pieces, which lets you focus on just the piece you want to."

"Functions are one way to do this abstraction in Python. Let's take "
"``turtle.reset()`` for example. ``reset`` is a function we call on our "
"``turtle``, and it is actually an abstraction for a number of steps, namely:"

"Python uses *indenting with whitespace* to identify blocks of code that "
"belong together. In Python a block (like the function definitions shown "

"Never use tab characters to indent your blocks, only spaces. You can -- and "

"The problem with using tab characters is that other python programmers use "
"spaces, and if both are used in the same file python will read it wrong (in "
"the best place, it will complain, and in the worst case, weird, hard to "
"debug bugs will happen)."
