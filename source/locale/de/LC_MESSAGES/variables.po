"places in the code each time. Imagine you'd want to experiment with all of "

"This is where **variables** come into play: You can tell Python that from "
"now on, whenever you refer to a variable, you actually mean something else. "
"That concept might be familiar from symbolic maths, where you would write: "
"*Let x be 5.* Then *x \\* 2* will obviously be *10*."

"Variables can store all sorts of things, not just numbers. A typical other "
"thing you want to have stored often is a **string** - a line of text. "
"Strings are indicated with a starting and a leading ``\"`` (double quote). "
"You'll learn about this and other types, as those are called in Python, and "
"what you can do with them later on."

"You can calculate the length of the diagonal line with the Pythagorean "

" the square root of a number in Python, you'll need to import the *math* "
"module and use the ``math.sqrt()`` function. The square of a number is "
"calculated with the ``**`` operator::"
