Learning Python
===============

Hopefully this tutorial has tought you just enough python to get you on your 
feet. However, there is much more that you can learn! Even professional
programmers will always be trying to learn more about their language and 
how to code excellently with it.


Books and Tutorials
-------------------

If you like learning from a book, there are heaps of good ones, and even many 
that can be read freely on the web!

- `OTS Python Portal`_ - Check the rest of our tutorials, and look out for 
  future workshops!
- `O'Reilly`_ publishes hundreds of books and ebooks, on python and many other 
  technologies (check out Learning Python, 5th edition).
- `Invent with Python`_ takes a practical approach, with three different ebooks 
  that can be read online for free.
- `Learn Python the Hard Way`_ is a step by step full tutorial on the language, 
  done in a unique style.
- `Dive into Python 3`_ is another great book available online for free!
- Last but not least, python.org has `Its own tutorial!`_

Online learning courses
-------------------------

You wouldn't believe what you can do on the web these days. There are many 
courses on programming around!

- `Edx`_ - with top universities like Stanford, MIT, Harvard and Berkley giving
  out interactive courses for free, it's hard to turn this down. You'll have 
  to look for ones coming up soon!
- `Coursera`_ is very similar to Edx, with even more courses, and some that 
  can be taken at any time.
- `CodeAcademy`_ - luckily this one has a python-specific course that can 
  be taken at any time, and many other practical language courses.

What to do with Python
======================

Well, that's a tough one! See, practically anything you can think of involving 
some electronics - from your TV remote, to a smartphone, to the backend of a 
popular web service, to the scheduling of airport landings, to the software 
you use everyday - it all involves some programming somewhere!

And not only is it a big field practically, but also technically and 
academically. As soon as you have a basic understanding of a general language 
like python, you can start working on all manner of subjects:  web frontends, 
web backend services, data analysis and statistics, Artificial Intelligence, 
GUI design, robotics, software development of all kinds, online transactions, 
automation of everything, and many more.

We wouldn't blame if that all sounds daunting, so here's some practical advice, 
that takes advantage of how wide a field "programming" is:

**Apply your new skills to whatever you're passionate about.**

Whether that's starting a new business, helping you do some task involving data 
faster, putting up an online site, calculating advantages in a game you play, 
creating art and music, or anything else, finding out how to use programming to 
help with whatever floats your boat will make learning much more exciting and 
relevant. Feel free to ask someone more experienced if you have no idea where 
to start, but always mention what makes you tick!
