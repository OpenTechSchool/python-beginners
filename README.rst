Introduction to programming with Python
***************************************

This workshop is an introduction to basic programming concepts and
abstractions.  It is laid out for hands-on workshops taking up roughly 4 hours.
While we have tried to be compatible with Python 2 _and_ 3 wherever possible,
we'd strongly encourage you to use Python 3.

The initial version of this material was loosely based on the "Python f√ºr Kids"
book by Gregor Lingl.  It is conceptual-- rather than incidental --that it
trades in idioms for learnability.  We believe that beginners sometimes have to
jump through one or another hoop to fully comprehend the scope and
applicability of a concept.  Every introduced abstraction solves another pain
point in the life of a beginning programmer.

HTML Version
============

You can view this workshop being hosted here:

The following sections are for people who want to contribute.

Setup
=====

This workshop is written in the reStructuredText_ format. The
``.rst`` files can be edited with a normal text editor.

It can be rendered to several output formats using Sphinx_. To do that, you
need to have the following Python packages installed:

- docutils
- Pygments
- Sphinx
- Fabric
- sphinx-intl

You can install these with pip using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Build
=====

The fabric script ``fabfile.py`` contains tasks making the build process very
easy. The following commands have to be executed in the ``docs`` directory.

If you just want to render the HTML version, it's sufficient to run

.. code:: bash

    fab build

This will create a directory ``_build``,
containing the HTML version.

Other `builders <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/builders.html#builders>`_ can be
passed as argument. For instance use ``singlehtml`` to render the whole
tutorial into a single HTML file.

.. code:: bash

   fab build:singlehtml

Translation
=============

1. Translation (pot) templates must be built or updated - ``fab gen_pots``
2. Templates must merged/built into po translation files - ``fab update_pos:de``

.. note:: Both 1 and 2 can be done with ``fab update_pos``

3. po files must be checked and translated correctly
4. ``fab build`` will compile po files, and build the docs for each language

.. note:: only po files should be committed to version control. pot and mo
   files are built automatically.


Deploy
======

The workshop is deployed as a `GitHub Page`_. A good way to do
that is described `here <https://gist.github.com/791759>`_. To simplify this
process, you can use the fabric target ``setup``.

.. code:: bash

   fab setup

This recreates the ``_build/html`` folder by building the project, while the 
folder is cloned to the ``gh-pages`` branch. You can simple cd into the folder 
thereafter and push new updates, or use ``fab build`` to rebuild it.
