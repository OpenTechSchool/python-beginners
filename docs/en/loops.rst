Loops
*****

Introduction
============

One more thing: Our programs often featured repetition. There is a powerful
concept in Python called looping, which we will elaborate later on. For now,
try this easy example::

    for i in range(10):
        print("Hello!")

This is incredibly helpful if we want to do something multiple times --- say,
drawing the individual border lines of a shape --- but only want to write it
once.  But it gets better::

    for i in range(10):
        print(i)


Notice how we write only one line of code using ``i`` but it has 10 different
values?

You can also loop over elements of your choice (mathematicians call this
"extensional sets")::

    for i in 5, 7, 11, 13:
        print(i)

The ``range(n)`` function can be considered a shorthand for ``0, 1, 2, ..., n-1``.
If you want to know more about it, you can use the help in the Python shell by
typing ``help(range)``. Use the :kbd:`q` key to exit the help again.

Drawing a dashed line
=====================

Exercise
--------

Draw a dashed line.  You can move the turtle without tracing a line behind you
with the ``turtle.penup()`` function;  put it back on the ground with
``turtle.pendown()``.

.. image:: /images/dashed.png

Solution
--------

::

    for i in range(10):
        turtle.forward(15)
        turtle.penup()
        turtle.forward(5)
        turtle.pendown()

Bonus
-----

Can you make the dashes become larger as the line progresses?

.. hint::

   Feeling lost?  Inspect ``i`` at every run of the loop::

       for i in range(10):
           print i
           turtle.forward(15)
           turtle.penup()
           turtle.forward(5)
           turtle.pendown()

   Can you utilize ``i`` --- commonly called the index variable or loop
   variable --- to get increasing step sizes?

Honeycomb loops
===============

Exercise
--------

Take your honeycomb program and make it easier with loops. How small can you
get it?

Solution
--------

::

    def hexagon():
        for i in range(6):
            turtle.forward(100)
            turtle.left(60)

    for i in range(6):
        hexagon()
        turtle.forward(100)
        turtle.right(60)
